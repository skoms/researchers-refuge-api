I was nudged into this thought by a recent Washington Post story about Brianna Wu, who had been the target of extreme harassment several years ago during the GamerGate situation. She is apparently getting contacted by some former members of that group, who are sending apologies and regrets for their past actions. The story reminded me of something that happened to me way back when, during the days of the BBS (bulletin board system).",

The company continues to build and sanitize its business, removing racist, misogynist, and otherwise controversial communities, as it prepares to go public at some point in the future. “We are still planning on going public, but we don’t have a firm timeline there yet,” Reddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told The New York Times in an interview. “All good companies should go public when they can.” The company previously raised $250 million in funding earlier this year for a valuation of $6 billion. But Huffman told the Times the company was approached with this recent financing round by Fidelity Investments and were made “an offer that we couldn’t refuse.”",

      "body": "Google has banned a company that sold Android users’ location data for COVID-19 mapping and other purposes, Motherboard reports. SafeGraph was one of several companies that collected geolocation records through plug-ins in other Android apps, then aggregated it for organizations including The New York Times and Centers for Disease Control. According to Motherboard, Google told developers in June that they had to remove SafeGraph’s software development kit within seven days. Motherboard says it’s not clear whether SafeGraph is still collecting any data from Android apps, and The Verge has reached out to Google and SafeGraph to confirm. SafeGraph’s ban follows an earlier crackdown on location-collecting apps. In December 2020, Google and Apple banned a similar service called X-Mode Social, which reportedly worked with the US military among other customers. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on its policy around SafeGraph.  SafeGraph data is supposed to be anonymized, but as Motherboard discusses, location datasets can often reveal details about individuals despite these safeguards. And although users must approve location-gathering by individual apps, many aren’t aware of how their information is being used.",

      "body": "Environmental microbiology is a growing niche area related to environmental biology, but dealing with the biology of lifeforms too small to see with the naked eye. Environmental microbiologists examine microbes as they relate to the environment - their effects on the landscape and how they are affected by it. This will include the spread of viruses and bacteria, and the distribution of algae, fungi and parasitical organisms. Some of these have profound implications to human health and others provide vital services to the environment. Every form of life that shares the ecology with us performs a function for local ecologies.Environmental microbiology is less concerned with the makeup and form of these lifeforms as it is with the distribution and relationship with the wider environment. Therefore, Geographic Information Systems is a necessary tool for the discipline. Those wishing to become GIS specialists within the field of microbiology in the U.S. have no specific options to study the method at undergraduate level. It is advisable to apply for an environmental microbiology program based on the availability of GIS as an elective or minor subject - where it is offered, it is important to take as an elective or minor it if you expect to work with geographic data. Those who wish to go into GIS specialism need to go on to further study to narrow their area of expertise. With GIS, environmental microbiologists can work quickly and efficiently with the geographic data elements with which they sometimes work. In this, they are able to assist ecologist, health professionals and others in monitoring trends over a small or large area such as plotting the outbreak of disease (1, p50-9) or mapping distribution of microbial life (2). In this field, it allows specialists to examine local, regional, national or global trends to assist decision makers in plotting conservation strategies or where to allocation resources.

      "topic": "environmental studies and forestry",
      "intro": "What is a Desert? Deserts conjure up specific ideas about topography: typically, that they are dry and sandy dunes or rock, or a mixture of both. But deserts are far more than this and there are multiple types.",
      "body": "How we define the desert biome are not about the types of rock, or the amount of sand, or even the temperature because there are both cold and hot deserts. The simple explanation is that deserts are topographic landscapes that receive little precipitation in a typical year. The threshold is 10 inches, or 25cm. But more than simply having low rainfall, a desert is “arid”. This means a high rate of water loss through plant reclamation (called transpiration) and through evaporation. These two aspects are combined into something called evapotranspiration. This is the amount of water that the landscape would lose when available (1). For deserts, evapotranspiration ratio exceeds average annual rainfall by anything from 2:1 to 33:1. The higher the ratio, the less available moisture there is. The coarse nature of the soil means most moisture seeps through the top soil rapidly. Furthermore, what precipitation a desert does experience is erratic. The average rainfall is just that. A desert may receive far more than the “average” in one year and not experience any rainfall the year before and the year after. Deserts will differ depending on their climate and location and their overall aridity can influence many things, not least of all the ecology, food chain, plant and animal types. High evaporation leaves behind higher salt levels, affecting further which plants can grow and the individual size and the numbers of herbivores that may feed on them and, in turn, carnivores. Some experience vast temperature fluctuations, especially hot deserts which may reach unbearable heat during the day and extreme cold at night (2). This is because the rock and sand absorb heat during the day and releases it at night. There may also be an extreme variation between warm and cool seasons, including extreme winds and storms due to the mixing of cold and warm air.",

      "topic": "computer science",
      "intro": "If you’re a web developer who creates graphical user interfaces (GUI) for your applications, then you’re probably familiar with accessibility but possibly daunted by all it entails.",
      "body": "Four core principles of accessibility Accessible user interfaces follow these four basic principles: Perceivable information and user interface: Users with disabilities can view and understand all the content on your site. Operable user interface and navigation: Users with disabilities are able to navigate your GUI and use all the necessary functions. Understandable information and user interface: All information is presented in a clearly structured and predictable way and provides clear guidance and help for correcting mistakes. Robust content and reliable interpretation: Your GUI needs to be compatible with current and future tools (for example, different browsers, assistive technologies, and other user agents). Because this is a very technical requirement, we will not focus on this principle in this article. Now that you know the four main principles, let’s look at some tips for creating accessible GUIs. While these don’t align 1:1 with the principles above, the most important thing is that whatever you add to your GUI, check that it does comply with at least the first 3 principles! Disclaimer: Making a GUI accessible for blind persons (who navigate your GUI with a screen reader) is a complex task which requires measures that go far beyond what I discuss in this article. Instead, I focus mainly on users with limited vision, mobility, and physical impairments. However, it’s important to design your GUI also for “screen readability” from the start in order to be future-proof.",

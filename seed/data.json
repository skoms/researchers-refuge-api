I was nudged into this thought by a recent Washington Post story about Brianna Wu, who had been the target of extreme harassment several years ago during the GamerGate situation. She is apparently getting contacted by some former members of that group, who are sending apologies and regrets for their past actions. The story reminded me of something that happened to me way back when, during the days of the BBS (bulletin board system).",

The company continues to build and sanitize its business, removing racist, misogynist, and otherwise controversial communities, as it prepares to go public at some point in the future. “We are still planning on going public, but we don’t have a firm timeline there yet,” Reddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told The New York Times in an interview. “All good companies should go public when they can.” The company previously raised $250 million in funding earlier this year for a valuation of $6 billion. But Huffman told the Times the company was approached with this recent financing round by Fidelity Investments and were made “an offer that we couldn’t refuse.”",

      "body": "Google has banned a company that sold Android users’ location data for COVID-19 mapping and other purposes, Motherboard reports. SafeGraph was one of several companies that collected geolocation records through plug-ins in other Android apps, then aggregated it for organizations including The New York Times and Centers for Disease Control. According to Motherboard, Google told developers in June that they had to remove SafeGraph’s software development kit within seven days. Motherboard says it’s not clear whether SafeGraph is still collecting any data from Android apps, and The Verge has reached out to Google and SafeGraph to confirm. SafeGraph’s ban follows an earlier crackdown on location-collecting apps. In December 2020, Google and Apple banned a similar service called X-Mode Social, which reportedly worked with the US military among other customers. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on its policy around SafeGraph.  SafeGraph data is supposed to be anonymized, but as Motherboard discusses, location datasets can often reveal details about individuals despite these safeguards. And although users must approve location-gathering by individual apps, many aren’t aware of how their information is being used.",

      "body": "Environmental microbiology is a growing niche area related to environmental biology, but dealing with the biology of lifeforms too small to see with the naked eye. Environmental microbiologists examine microbes as they relate to the environment - their effects on the landscape and how they are affected by it. This will include the spread of viruses and bacteria, and the distribution of algae, fungi and parasitical organisms. Some of these have profound implications to human health and others provide vital services to the environment. Every form of life that shares the ecology with us performs a function for local ecologies.Environmental microbiology is less concerned with the makeup and form of these lifeforms as it is with the distribution and relationship with the wider environment. Therefore, Geographic Information Systems is a necessary tool for the discipline. Those wishing to become GIS specialists within the field of microbiology in the U.S. have no specific options to study the method at undergraduate level. It is advisable to apply for an environmental microbiology program based on the availability of GIS as an elective or minor subject - where it is offered, it is important to take as an elective or minor it if you expect to work with geographic data. Those who wish to go into GIS specialism need to go on to further study to narrow their area of expertise. With GIS, environmental microbiologists can work quickly and efficiently with the geographic data elements with which they sometimes work. In this, they are able to assist ecologist, health professionals and others in monitoring trends over a small or large area such as plotting the outbreak of disease (1, p50-9) or mapping distribution of microbial life (2). In this field, it allows specialists to examine local, regional, national or global trends to assist decision makers in plotting conservation strategies or where to allocation resources.

      "topic": "environmental studies and forestry",
      "intro": "What is a Desert? Deserts conjure up specific ideas about topography: typically, that they are dry and sandy dunes or rock, or a mixture of both. But deserts are far more than this and there are multiple types.",
      "body": "How we define the desert biome are not about the types of rock, or the amount of sand, or even the temperature because there are both cold and hot deserts. The simple explanation is that deserts are topographic landscapes that receive little precipitation in a typical year. The threshold is 10 inches, or 25cm. But more than simply having low rainfall, a desert is “arid”. This means a high rate of water loss through plant reclamation (called transpiration) and through evaporation. These two aspects are combined into something called evapotranspiration. This is the amount of water that the landscape would lose when available (1). For deserts, evapotranspiration ratio exceeds average annual rainfall by anything from 2:1 to 33:1. The higher the ratio, the less available moisture there is. The coarse nature of the soil means most moisture seeps through the top soil rapidly. Furthermore, what precipitation a desert does experience is erratic. The average rainfall is just that. A desert may receive far more than the “average” in one year and not experience any rainfall the year before and the year after. Deserts will differ depending on their climate and location and their overall aridity can influence many things, not least of all the ecology, food chain, plant and animal types. High evaporation leaves behind higher salt levels, affecting further which plants can grow and the individual size and the numbers of herbivores that may feed on them and, in turn, carnivores. Some experience vast temperature fluctuations, especially hot deserts which may reach unbearable heat during the day and extreme cold at night (2). This is because the rock and sand absorb heat during the day and releases it at night. There may also be an extreme variation between warm and cool seasons, including extreme winds and storms due to the mixing of cold and warm air.",

      "intro": "If you’re a web developer who creates graphical user interfaces (GUI) for your applications, then you’re probably familiar with accessibility but possibly daunted by all it entails.",
      "body": "Four core principles of accessibility Accessible user interfaces follow these four basic principles: Perceivable information and user interface: Users with disabilities can view and understand all the content on your site. Operable user interface and navigation: Users with disabilities are able to navigate your GUI and use all the necessary functions. Understandable information and user interface: All information is presented in a clearly structured and predictable way and provides clear guidance and help for correcting mistakes. Robust content and reliable interpretation: Your GUI needs to be compatible with current and future tools (for example, different browsers, assistive technologies, and other user agents). Because this is a very technical requirement, we will not focus on this principle in this article. Now that you know the four main principles, let’s look at some tips for creating accessible GUIs. While these don’t align 1:1 with the principles above, the most important thing is that whatever you add to your GUI, check that it does comply with at least the first 3 principles! Disclaimer: Making a GUI accessible for blind persons (who navigate your GUI with a screen reader) is a complex task which requires measures that go far beyond what I discuss in this article. Instead, I focus mainly on users with limited vision, mobility, and physical impairments. However, it’s important to design your GUI also for “screen readability” from the start in order to be future-proof.",

      "topic": "philosophy",
      "intro": "Born into slavery, then crippled by his master and exiled by the Emperor Domitian, Epictetus (c.60-135 CE) has become arguably the central figure in today’s global revival of Stoicism.",
      "body": "A straight-talking advocate of the idea philosophy should help people flourish even in hard times, Epictetus has much to offer as we wrestle with pandemic lockdowns and uncertainty. Here are four tips from perhaps the most stoic of the Stoics: \n\n1. Don’t worry about things we can’t control \nThe start of Epictetus’ Enchiridion handbook lays out his famous “dichotomy of control”: \n*Of things some are depend upon us, and others do not. In our power are opinion, impulse, desire, aversion. Not in our power are the body, property, reputation, offices, and in a word, whatever are not our own acts.* \n\nIt’s an idea that echoes today in the Serenity Prayer of 12-step recovery programs. If we worry about things we can’t change, Epictetus continues, we are wasting our energies. If we imagine that we can control the past or future — or even pandemics — we are setting ourselves up for disappointment. \n\nBut we can think and act, and do our best to respond to situations with courage, justice, and moderation. \n\nToday’s citizens in lockdown can’t control whether (or when) restrictions are lifted. We can all however wear masks, social distance, get vaccinated as soon as possible, and continue working, exercising and educating our kids as best we can.",

      "intro": "The man widely known in the English language as Confucius was born around 551 BCE in today’s southern Shandong Province. Confucius is the phonic translation of the Chinese word Kong fuzi 孔夫子, in which Kong 孔 was his surname and fuzi is an honorific for learned men.",
      "body": "Widely credited for creating the system of thought we now call Confucianism, this learned man insisted he was “not a maker but a transmitter”, merely “believing in and loving the ancients”. In this, Confucius could be seen as acting modestly and humbly, virtues he thought of highly. \n\nOr, as Kang Youwei — a leading reformer in modern China has argued — Confucius tactically framed his revolutionary ideas as lost ancient virtues so his arguments would be met with fewer criticisms and less hostility. \n\nConfucius looked nothing like the great sage in his own time as he is widely known in ours. To his contemporaries, he was perhaps foremost an unemployed political adviser who wandered around different fiefdoms for some years, attempting to sell his political ideas to different rulers — but never able to strike a deal. \n\nIt seems Confucius would have preferred to live half a millennium earlier, when China — according to him — was united under benevolent, competent and virtuous rulers at the dawn of the Zhou dynasty. By his own time, China had become a divided land with hundreds of small fiefdoms, often ruled by greedy, cruel or mediocre lords frequently at war. \n\nBut this frustrated scholar’s ideas have profoundly shaped politics and ethics in and beyond China ever since his death in 479 BCE. The greatest and the most influential Chinese thinker, his concept of filial piety, remains highly valued among young people in China, despite rapid changes in the country’s demography. \n\nDespite some doubts as to whether many Chinese people take his ideas seriously, the ideas of Confucius remain directly and closely relevant to contemporary China.",

      "topic": "philosophy",
      "intro": "Have you ever wondered if you’re just a character in some elaborate simulation? You shake the thought off because you’re a real person, living a real life, in a concrete reality. But can you be certain that you are? Isn’t it at least possible that your body and that the world around you are nothing but illusions?",
      "body": "This is the conundrum that Guy, played by Ryan Reynolds, finds himself in the middle of in the film Free Guy. However, in this case he is, in fact, an NPC (non-player character) in an open-world computer game called Free City. He is a character in a simulation, and this realisation changes his “life” forever. \n\nMany of us have wondered if we, like Guy, are just NPCs in some game. A sceptical hypothesis like this was first raised by the 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes. He didn’t imagine he might be an NPC, of course. He imagined that an evil demon might be deceiving him into thinking the world around him was real when it was not. But evil demons are considered a bit passé these days. \n\nIn 20th-century philosophy, the favoured alternative was to imagine that we might be brains in vats hooked up to electrodes being deceived by nefarious neuroscientists feeding our experiences into us via electrical impulses. This is (more or less) the basic premise of the film The Matrix. But now even brains in vats are old hat. \n\nContemporary philosophy instead asks us to imagine that we are living in a computer simulation and that our minds themselves are mere emulations that run on computer code. This hypothesis has been taken seriously by many philosophers and scientists, with some arguing that the hypothesis is not only possible but has a good chance of being true. So, the question of whether you are in a situation similar to Guy’s is a genuine one worth thinking over. \n\n## Do we have free will?  \n\nSo if we are like Guy and living in a computer simulation, what becomes of our free will? \n\nIn the movie, Guy certainly feels like he has free will, but admits that his thoughts and behaviour is down to his programming. And there certainly seems to be something right about this. If our minds were nothing but a computer program running on a server somewhere, then it’s hard to see how we could have any real control over what we think and do. Everything would be determined by our programming.",

      "topic": "the arts",
      "intro": "Are you ready to pursue a culinary arts degree program?",
      "body": "You've heard it all: bachelor's degree holders earn more money, a 4-year degree gives you a broader education, employers prefer bachelor's degrees, and so on. \n\nBut is a bachelor degree in culinary arts actually going to confer real-life advantages that you wouldn't get from an associate's degree or diploma? \n\nSome might argue that if you have the right job experience, whether you have one, two, or four years of education shouldn't make much of a difference to your success in a culinary career. \n\nThere are other factors affecting your educational decisions, too, such as the financial resources you're able to devote to paying for school, how quickly you need to enter the workforce and how much time you have to spend on classes. In the end, though, choosing a certificate, an associate's degree or a bachelor's degree in culinary arts depends on what you ultimately hope to get out of your education and where your career goals lie. \n\n## Who Should Consider a Bachelor's Degree in Culinary Arts?  \n\nIt might be hard to imagine why paying for four years of education is a good idea when you could be out of school and on the job in two years or fewer. But generally speaking, you can earn twice as much money with a bachelor's degree than just a high school diploma, and that's the case across the career spectrum. There are other reasons, too, to consider a bachelor degree in culinary arts: \n\n * **Go beyond the basics.** Bachelor's degrees always include liberal arts and other general education courses in addition to your culinary curriculum. Besides enjoying the intellectual challenge of a well-rounded education, you'll gain skills in other areas—knowledge that might come in handy if you ever need to look for work outside of the culinary industry.\n\n * **Prepare yourself for higher education.** With a bachelor's degree, you'll have the minimum qualification to enter a master's degree program in culinary arts—a must if your plan is to teach at a culinary school. Nutritionists, dietitians, food scientists and many restaurant owners also hold master's degrees.\n\n * **Get management training.** A bachelor's degree will give you the same hands-on training that you'll get in a diploma or associate's program, but you'll also have the option to study finance, business and management in some depth. Expertise in these areas will make it easier to move through the ranks and attain managerial roles.\n\nKnowing your own needs and aspirations is paramount to making the right educational decision. Having a clear idea of what a bachelor degree in culinary arts offers, compared to a diploma or associate's degree, will help make that decision a little easier.",

      "body": "Some natural features also have person-like rights. But both of those required changes to the legal system. A new argument has laid a path for artificial intelligence systems to be recognized as people too – without any legislation, court rulings or other revisions to existing law. \n\nLegal scholar Shawn Bayern has shown that anyone can confer legal personhood on a computer system, by putting it in control of a limited liability corporation in the U.S. If that maneuver is upheld in courts, artificial intelligence systems would be able to own property, sue, hire lawyers and enjoy freedom of speech and other protections under the law. In my view, human rights and dignity would suffer as a result. \n\n## The corporate loophole  \n\nGiving AIs rights similar to humans involves a technical lawyerly maneuver. It starts with one person setting up two limited liability companies and turning over control of each company to a separate autonomous or artificially intelligent system. Then the person would add each company as a member of the other LLC. In the last step, the person would withdraw from both LLCs, leaving each LLC – a corporate entity with legal personhood – governed only by the other’s AI system. \n\nThat process doesn’t require the computer system to have any particular level of intelligence or capability. It could just be a sequence of “if” statements looking, for example, at the stock market and making decisions to buy and sell based on prices falling or rising. It could even be an algorithm that makes decisions randomly, or an emulation of an amoeba.",

      "topic": "chemical engineering",
      "intro": "Mary Shelley was 20 when she published “Frankenstein” in 1818. Two hundred years on, the book remains thrilling, challenging and relevant — especially for scientists like me whose research involves tinkering with the stuff of life.",
      "body": "The story of Dr. Victor Frankenstein is familiar: A deranged scientist muddles with corpses and creates a monster. Or, a naive young man makes a mistake and is forced to live with it. Or, a college student dives headfirst into biotechnology without once considering the consequences. \n\nThe prose may be a bit dated, but the issues at the heart of “Frankenstein” feel modern. Biotechnology and bioengineering are real things now. Scientists can still be blinded by their passions. And, just as true today as in pre-Victorian Britain, the future is hard to predict. \n\n“Frankenstein” endures because it addresses a perennial fear: What if science goes too far? What happens if we build something we don’t understand and can’t control? Are there certain roads in science or technology that we just shouldn’t go down? \n\nAs a doctoral student in synthetic biology, my day job is to try to engineer life. And after rereading “Frankenstein,” I couldn’t shake one thought: If Mary Shelley were writing the book today, Victor would surely be a synthetic biologist. \n\n## Building life  \n\nVictor Frankenstein, the character who creates the Creature (who, in the book, has no name), was 17 when he left home to study natural science at university. An eloquent professor sparks a passion in him. Victor resolves to take science further than anyone – to “explore unknown powers,” as he puts it. Within three years, Victor begins digging up dead bodies. \n\nClearly Victor takes his passion — or perhaps obsession — too far. But what Victor did – taking different parts from living things and stitching them together — is not on the face of it that different from the field of research I work in. \n\nSynthetic biology seeks to engineer new biological systems such as biomolecules, metabolic pathways or cells, using either natural or synthetic parts. \n\nA synthetic biologist looks at life with an engineer’s eye. Antibiotic resistance can be rolled back by infecting certain bacteria with the right protein. Algae, when genetically reprogrammed, can synthesize biofuels. Bolt Threads, a Bay Area startup, is making clothes from synthetic spider silk. And to understand more about the basic code of life, synthetic biologists have stripped microbes down to only their most essential stretches of DNA. \n\nMy own doctoral research is focused on trying to design new biomolecules that break down chemical weapons. Before starting grad school, I worked for a company that’s turning agricultural plant waste into liquid fuels by stringing together fungal enzymes that naturally degrade wood. Biology is powerful, and much its complexity is only now becoming known. \n\nBut talk of “engineering biology” makes a lot people squeamish. The sanctity of life is violated when man tries to play God, they argue. It’s a fool’s errand, or worse. That is one plausible interpretation of “Frankenstein.” Perhaps Shelley meant to show us, over 200 gripping pages, the agony that awaits anyone arrogant enough to tinker with life. \n\nIt’s this interpretation of “Frankenstein,” more or less, that has taken root in modern society, especially with regard to biotechnology. Since 1992, genetically modified foods have been derided as “Frankenfoods,” even though the vast majority of scientists regard them as safe and beneficial. Like the hostile townsfolk and farmers who rejected the Creature, many in modern society believe biotechnology is something to run away from. \n\n## Running from responsibility  \n\nBut in the book, it’s Victor who runs. \n\n“Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room,” says Victor, moments after bringing the Creature to life. The new being, who cannot yet speak, eventually wanders outside only to be driven from society. The Creature spends most of the rest of the book aching for genuine connection – in town squares, farmyards and icy plains. Without exception he is met with violence and scorn. With his innocence shattered, the Creature turns toward revenge. \n\nTechnology can turn monstrous, but I read Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” not as an injunction against bioengineering as such. Rather, the story reveals what can happen when we – scientists and nonscientists alike – run away from the responsibilities that science and technology demand. \n\nVictor is a deeply flawed scientist. He is solitary, lacks foresight and is blinded by a selfish desire for power. He abandons his work when he realizes it could be dangerous, but at that point it’s already too late. This is alien to the community of synthetic biologists I know, who are vocal about the potential dangers of the technologies they develop and are actively working to ensure their safety. \n\nKevin Esvelt, the MIT biotechnologist who created a method for editing the DNA of wild organisms at will, has shifted the focus of his lab toward the responsible development and deployment of the technology – going so far as to state that the system as currently constructed should not be used by anyone. \n\nJennifer Doudna, a pioneer of CRISPR gene-editing technology, has called for a moratorium on potentially irreversible gene editing in humans. Feng Zhang, another CRISPR co-inventor, likewise has stated that “we need be very careful and proceed with a lot of caution.” Speaking about the dangers of runaway biotechnology at the 2018 World Economic Forum, Zhang stated that “it would be important to engineer containment mechanisms” into any bioengineered cells. These would be akin to a genetic fail-safe should something unexpectedly go wrong. \n\nModern bioengineers order DNA ingredients through the mail, with no need for grave robbing. U.S. Department of Energy, CC BY \n\n## A modern Victor Frankenstein  \n\nIf written today, Victor would be stitching together bits of DNA in a sterile lab somewhere. But I like to think his perspective on bioengineering would become modern as well. The synthetic biology community I know practices openness, prudence and self-restraint. Instead of running from responsibility, we try to embrace it – perhaps in part because of cautionary stories like “Frankenstein.” \n\nIn an early moment of irony and foreshadowing, Victor invites the reader to wonder “how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.” He means to be awe-inspiring, but readers familiar with the tale understand his statement to be quite the opposite. \n\nVictor Frankenstein was certainly careless and perhaps a coward, unable to own up to the responsibility of what he was doing. We now know that science is best conducted with humility, forethought and in the light of day.",

      "intro": "Children are naturally inquisitive and tolerant. Many constantly ask questions. At some point, most of them – most of us – just stop.",
      "body": "## Why does this happen? \n\nIt’s not as if the world starts to make perfect sense after several years of living. There are social pressures to stop. To succeed, to be recognized as smart, children typically feel pressure to stop asking questions and start providing answers. What is 2+2? How do you spell “cat”? What time is it when the big hand is on the 11 and the little hand is on the 5? \n\nBut no one should ever stop asking questions. I say this as someone whose job it is to ask them, and to help college-aged students and adolescents develop the skills to ask questions insightfully. \n\nI believe that asking questions should be of the utmost importance to anyone who cares about themselves or others. \n\n## A threat to inquiry \n\nDuring the summer of 2020, on TikTok, a young woman named Gracie Cunningham mused about the origins of algebra and about whether math is “real” while applying her makeup. The video went viral when, in a since-deleted tweet, it was posted with the caption “dumbest video ive ever seen.” \n\n Gracie’s musings were mocked – until they weren’t. After being ridiculed by many who saw the tweet, others came to Gracie’s defense, including professional mathematicians, scientists and philosophers. More people then defended Gracie in light of the authority of the mathematicians, scientists and philosophers. For not even they, the savants, knew the answers to her questions. \n\nI think this episode is worth examining for what it indicates about questions and the importance of tolerating inquiry. \n\n Given the comments the tweet provoked, Gracie’s questions initially appeared silly to many who heard them. Such mockery – even the mere threat of being laughed at – is a significant deterrent to asking questions and to inquiry more generally. \n\nShe seemed like an easy target. Her questions were directed at something that is widely supposed to be unquestionable: namely, basic mathematics. Few of those who defended Gracie did so on the grounds that her questions were sincere or revealed a genuine inquisitiveness or were insightful. \n\nIt seems the primary reason the questions came to be deemed good is just that it was noticed they did not have easy answers. \n\n## Questions good and bad \n\nLots of very good questions have easy answers if you ask the right person, though. Often, a good question is just motivated by curiosity, asked in order to understand better something in the world, including oneself. By this measure, Gracie’s questions were good ones all along. \n\n## So are all questions good? \n\nNo. Despite the cliché to the contrary, there are plenty of bad questions. A question asked while someone else is talking is usually not a good one (though it might be good to interrupt to ask “Is there a doctor here?” if someone nearby passes out). Nor is the same question asked over and over again, such as “Are we there yet?” or “Is it time?” I say this as a father of two small children with a tendency to ask questions for which the answers are clearly not the goal. \n\nStill, maybe these questions aren’t good because of the context or their impetus. Perhaps every question asked from a place of curiosity is a good one? \n\nThis isn’t so either. \n\nConsider whether it’s appropriate to ask: “Why do you look like that?” “Why do you cry so easily?” “Were you brought up in a barn?” “What are you?” – when querying someone’s ethnicity, race or gender. “Are you sexually active?” \n\nNot all aspects of the world are open to inquiry by everyone. And some inquiries can be harmful.",

      "intro": "There isn’t just one way to sound like a scientist, or to sound like a scholar. Scientists and scholars come from a wide variety of backgrounds and speak in different ways, in different accents, dialects and languages.",
      "body": "In classrooms across the U.S., students do too. No student (or teacher) leaves their language patterns at the door when they enter a classroom – even classes like math and science, where language is often seen as secondary. \n\nFor the past decade, as professors who study the role of language and culture in education, we’ve been working to help educators understand these dynamics across all subject areas. As the U.S. student population continues to rapidly diversify along cultural and linguistic lines, the demographics of the teacher population remain stable at roughly 82 percent white and predominantly female. \n\nHow can educators make sure that teaching and learning in their diverse classrooms is effective and equitable? \n\nUnderstanding how and why culture and communication matter in all areas of education – from science to the humanities – is a critical starting point. \n\n## When students don’t sound the same \n\nStudents who speak differently can face a number of challenges at school. \n\nStudies have found that at all levels of education, instructors often favor students who sound like themselves and can be biased against those who don’t. Educators might form negative assumptions about a student’s intelligence and ability based simply on how he or she talks, which can result in lowered expectations, stereotyping and discrimination. Teachers sometimes also send messages, whether consciously or unconsciously, that a student’s language is wrong, dumb or out of place at school. \n\nFor instance, consider what one mother told us about an interaction she witnessed in her son’s first grade classroom. One of the boys, who is African-American, was playing a game and realized he didn’t have the materials he needed. He raised his hand and said to the teacher, “I don’t got no dice.” His teacher immediately responded, “Joshua, we speak English in this class!” The mother was appalled and felt that this experience could discourage Joshua from speaking up at school. \n\nWhen students absorb and internalize such messages, they can experience what linguist William Labov called “linguistic insecurity” – feelings of anxiety and apprehension that can take root even at an early age. \n\nThese negative experiences with language and communication in the classroom can have a direct impact on students’ academic achievement. As early as kindergarten, students who come to school speaking in similar ways as their teachers are more likely to get ahead, whereas those who speak differently are more likely to fall behind. These language-based educational inequalities disproportionately affect African-American students and other students of color, English language learners and students who come from a social class or regional background that is different from that of their teacher. \n\nAs Joshua’s mother said to us, “There must be a better way to respond.” \n\n## Putting language into the equation \n\nFor the past decade, we’ve worked not only as scholars but as teacher trainers as well. Some of our professional development workshops are geared toward a particular group of educators: those who teach K-12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics, also known as STEM. \n\nIn 2011, we began a three-year study with 60 K-12 STEM educators in Maryland and Virginia to explore how language can affect teaching and learning for STEM students, particularly for African-American youth. The teachers were eager to learn, but also to share experiences from their own classroom teaching about the role that language can play in STEM – whether it’s answering a word problem in math, reading an engineering text or writing a lab report. \n\nOne of the biggest challenges is that, in STEM, word problems, questions, texts and directions often contain unfamiliar terms, both technical and nontechnical. In fact, nontechnical words can often be as problematic as the more specialist terms of science. “It’s kind of like learning a language twice,” a geometry teacher said, because “the vocabulary can be so intense.” \n\nAnd it’s not just vocabulary that matters; everyday classroom communication plays an important role, too. “We all use language,” one STEM teacher recognized, “whether it’s in the directions we give or the handouts we use.” \n\n## What can we do right now? \n\nHow can teachers make an immediate difference in their classes? For educators who want to know how to take this information and apply it directly to their teaching, there are relevant, accessible materials. \n\nThe Language and Life Project, out of North Carolina State University, hosts a number of videos and podcasts about language. \n\nIn addition to a comprehensive website, we created a series of webinars about the role of language in teaching and learning across the disciplines, as well as a podcast in which educators themselves describe how this information positively impacted their teaching and their relationships with students. \n\nThese materials can help teachers learn how to respond to students who speak differently, avoid cultural and linguistic bias on tests and design culturally supportive curricula. \n\nIn the course of our research, we also created a free iOS app (“Valuable Voices”) for educators. The app provides a year of monthly classroom-ready exercises and activities, adaptable for elementary through high school students. One exercise introduces students to the concept of language change by analyzing the linguistic innovations of William Shakespeare. Another activity invites students to explore “linguistic landscapes,” or the language found in public places and spaces around them. \n\n## Language matters \n\nGood teaching relies on effective communication, whether it’s in English class, biology class or any subject in between. The words that teachers and students use, their meanings and their intentions are central to classroom interactions and dynamics. Ensuring that students, peers and teachers from diverse backgrounds understand and communicate respectfully with each other is often just as important as helping students understand the material in their textbooks. \n\nLanguage matters – not just for fostering mutual respect, but for making sure that every student has an equal opportunity to succeed. \n\nAs one high school algebra teacher who participated in our study pointed out: \n\n“Spending time showing students how their language is respected, and allowing them to have the skills to analyze different ways of speaking and writing, creates a classroom where we celebrate what we can each bring to our learning environment.” \n\nSimply put, she said, “It’s worth our time.”",

      "title": "Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety and depression drugs consume energy drinks and coffee?",
      "topic": "family and consumer science",
      "intro": "About 6.1 million children in the U.S., more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.",
      "body": "Many kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take prescription stimulants, such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration. \n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder, such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too. \n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the high levels of caffeine those drinks contain. \n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine overstimulates the nervous system, which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety. \n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day, the equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda, without any trouble. \n\nHowever, just one energy drink, and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can disrupt blood sugar levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems. \n\nThe academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks, regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old drink these beverages on a regular basis. \n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their coffee consumption. \n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that not all of the young people taking those drugs need them. \n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition. Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat anxiety and depression. \n\nAs a nutritional neuroscientist who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs. \n\nOne reason for this is that the brain has a growth spurt during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids – typically found in high amounts in fish – that not all teens get enough of through their usual diet. A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress. \n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons. They often do this because of a mistaken belief that the drugs will help them do better at school. \n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.",

      "title": "Food is medicine: How US policy is shifting toward nutrition for better health",
      "topic": "family and consumer science",
      "intro": "In this new year, millions of Americans will make resolutions about healthier eating. In 2019, could U.S. government leaders further resolve to improve healthier eating as well, joining public health experts in seeing that food is medicine?",
      "body": "In 2018, Congress initiated a series of actions that represent a shift away from placing the full responsibility – and blame – on individual people to make their own healthier choices. These actions also show a growing recognition that many stakeholders – including the government – are accountable for a healthier, more equitable food system. This shift in thinking reflects an understanding that government can and should play a role in improving the diet of Americans. \n\nAs faculty members at Tufts University, our expertise spans clinical medicine, nutrition science, public health, policy analyses, Congress, federal agencies and government programs. It’s clear to us that the time is right for meaningful policy action to leverage food as medicine. \n\n## Why healthier eating is a national priority \n\nPoor diet is among the greatest health and societal challenges of our time, causing death and disability, soaring health care spending, budget challenges for governments and private business, diminished military readiness and population disparities. \n\nMedicare and Medicaid, the government programs that pay for medical care for people over age 65, low-income families, and the disabled, now consume US$1 in $4 in the federal budget. In addition, nearly $1 in $5 in the entire U.S. economy is spent on health care, creating massive threats to the health of the national economy. \n\nDiet-related diseases are major contributors to these expenses. For example, the annual medical and economic costs of heart disease and stroke are estimated at $316 billion; of diabetes, $327 billion; and of all obesity-related conditions, $1.42 trillion. These costs create enormous economic challenges for federal and state governments as well as for private American businesses, families, and individuals through rising health care premiums, out-pocket-costs, missed work and lower productivity. \n\nDiet-related health burdens and costs also influence military readiness. Two-thirds of active duty military forces are overweight or obese, while 71 percent of young Americans are unable to join the military for one or more reasons, with obesity as the leading medical disqualifier. \n\nThe overall U.S. food system – including farming and imports, supermarkets and retail, restaurants and cafeterias, and food manufacturers – also reflects and contributes to profound disparities, especially among children. Minorities and the poor often have the worst diets, causing a vicious cycle of poor health, lower school performance, lost productivity, increased health costs and poverty. \n\n## Hungry for good food \n\nAs policymakers increasingly recognize the depth and breadth of these effects, they are beginning to act. In January 2018, House lawmakers created a bipartisan “Food is Medicine” working group, dedicated to innovations in nutrition policy to improve health and reduce diet-related health costs. Simply the existence of a group in Congress focused on “Food is Medicine,” which hosted multiple briefings for congressional staff on key legislation to integrate nutrition into federal policy, is an advance. \n\nOn June 7, 2018, Congress instructed the U.S. Government Accountability Office to perform a comprehensive assessment and accounting of all federal policies related to food, chronic diseases and health care costs. The GAO is the government “watchdog,” providing independent audits of agencies and policies. The GAO has been asked to investigate six specific questions across diverse federal agencies and programs, including the evidence linking diet to chronic diseases, the corresponding national and federal health care costs, and the current strategies and missed opportunities to reduce these risks and costs. A series of GAO reports on food policy will likely come out in 2019 and 2020. The launch of this investigation represents a federal milestone for its scope and recognition of the opportunities in food policy. \n\nThe 2018 Farm Bill, signed into law on Dec. 20, 2018, included several important provisions for healthier eating, especially in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which supports about one in seven Americans. This included expansion of the fruit and vegetable subsidy program to $250 million, a new $25 million Produce Prescription Program and strengthening of SNAP-Education, a $400 million/year nutrition education program. Several of these advances were recommended by the 2018 Bipartisan Policy Center report on healthier SNAP, chaired by former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., and USDA Secretaries Ann Veneman and Dan Glickman. \n\nWhile there were advances in the Farm Bill, a proposed amendment to include pilot testing for medically tailored meals was rejected. Medically tailored meals are ready-to-eat, personalized meals provided at home to low-income patients with complex medical illnesses like cancer, HIV, diabetes or heart failure. Several recent studies show that providing medically tailored meals to patients is associated with reduced hospitalizations, emergency room visits and overall health care spending. While this is a missed opportunity in the Farm Bill, the state of California is currently testing the effects of medically tailored meals on health outcomes and costs in a $6 million Medicaid intervention across six counties, which will provide new evidence for possible future national expansion. \n\n## Your produce is ready \n\nAmong the Farm Bill changes, we believe that the new Produce Prescription Program holds special promise. Already offered by some nonprofit and private insurance programs, this new federal program will allow doctors to prescribe not just medications but also subsidized purchases of fruits and vegetables. While the $25 million represents a small relative investment, this direct federal commitment to evaluate produce prescriptions in health care has the potential to provide evidence to support future expansion throughout Medicaid and Medicare. \n\nTogether, these congressional activities in 2018 represent an evolution toward incorporating and addressing nutrition, diet-related diseases and their health care costs in federal policy. These actions build upon mounting public awareness of the central role of food in well-being; the accelerating consumer demand for, and corresponding industry shifts toward, healthier foods; and the growing recognition that individual consumers cannot be solely responsible for the current challenges in the food system.\n\n## Recommended policy actions \n\nThe recent congressional actions toward viewing food as medicine coincide with new scientific evidence on how specific government policies can improve nutrition and well-being, reduce health care costs and reduce disparities. \n\nWe believe that meaningful progress on these national challenges will require far more substantive policy changes that can make healthier eating the easy, accessible, less expensive option. Based on recent reviews of the science as well as our new research, particularly promising federal government strategies for consideration include: \n\n* Strengthening of nutrition standards in schools, after school, early childhood education programs and child feeding programs, as well as in cafeterias at federal worksites and other federal facilities, such as prisons and Veterans Affairs hospitals. \n\n* Federal incentives to incorporate nutrition into corporate worksite wellness programs, such as personalized, interactive technology platforms, gameification and economic incentives already available in private insurance and corporate programs. \n\n* A federal excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages and junk food, especially if tax revenues are used to subsidize healthier foods, making the latter’s prices both more affordable and closer to their true societal value. \n\n* Integrating nutrition into health care, including in the electronic health record, medical education and licensing standards, fruit and vegetable prescriptions, medically tailored meals, provider quality and reimbursement guidelines, and risk-sharing arrangements that incentivize providers to improve the health of their communities. \n\n* Leveraging the $70 billion per year SNAP program for better nutrition for low-income families, for example through further strengthening of SNAP-Education, increased subsidies for fruits and vegetables and a combined food incentive/disincentive program to nudge people toward healthier choices. \n\n* U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling standards and limits for additives such as salt, trans fat and added sugar; marketing standards to protect children; and evidence-based health claims for products that can help achieve better health. \n\n* Increased federal research funding, including a new National Institute of Nutrition at the National Institutes of Health; as well as economic incentives for transparent public-private partnerships for health-focused food innovation and entrepreneurship. \n\nPolicy change is often not linear. Based on the significant impacts of nutrition on disease, health care, the economy, military readiness, disparities and the environment, federal actions in 2018 laid the foundation for nonpartisan federal leadership to create meaningful and lasting solutions.",

      "topic": "social work",
      "intro": "The day the governor of California ordered the closure of dine-in restaurant operations, gyms, fitness centers and movie theaters because of the coronavirus, staff members of the Los Angeles Community Action Network, a grassroots human rights organization comprised of poor housed and houseless Angelenos, scouted the streets of Skid Row to check on the hand-washing stations the city had installed, phones in hand.",
      "body": "General Dogon, one of the staff, stopped at one station and pumped the foot pedal to turn it on. Turning to face his colleague Monique Noel’s phone camera, he said: “The problem is, there is no water.” \n\nIn Downtown Los Angeles’ Skid Row, an estimated 4,757 people experience houselessness on a given night, and approximately 2,783 of them live unsheltered on the street. These residents cannot easily follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advice to stay at home and wash their hands frequently. \n\nCity officials said they installed 250 hand-washing stations across the city, but by Dogon’s count on March 16, the day of the governor’s order, only a few had been placed in Skid Row. Several of the stations were dirty and lacked soap, fresh water or both. \n\nBefore COVID-19 became a crisis in LA, we – a Ph.D. student studying media power and cities, a Ph.D. student studying health interventions for youth experiencing homelessness and a professor studying social and economic impacts of information technologies – were engaged in participatory research projects with the Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA CAN) and other students in a USC-Annenberg graduate seminar on “Research, Practice and Social Change.” Recognizing the immense threat that COVID-19 poses to residents of informal settlements, this community-university collaborative began building a grassroots network of DIY hand-washing stations. \n\nThe hope is that others may learn from our story and provide rapid response to support houseless communities in their own neighborhoods and cities. We believe our story demonstrates the power and importance of community ownership and organizations that build grassroots networks over time. \n\n## Switching plans because of COVID-19 \n\nThe idea was born at a meeting of LA CAN’s Human Rights Strategy Committee where participants were discussing the impact of COVID-19 on the organization’s “Dirty Divide” campaign, a decades-long effort to advocate for improvements to Skid Row’s inadequate public health infrastructure. \n\nThat led to a conversation about how the Congolese fought the Ebola crisis – with sanitation stations – and how to emulate this in Skid Row. LA CAN shared the idea with the USC team on what would be the first of many Zoom videoconference calls over the following days. \n\nThe LA CAN / USC collaborative researched a number of DIY hand-washing station models, experimented with building prototypes and got five pilot stations on the streets within the first few days, with over a dozen more ready to be deployed soon. The group is also mapping the DIY stations, as well as existing sanitation spots and hand washing stations newly installed by the city. \n\nFor inspiration, the collaborative assembled a scrapbook of examples from around the world showing how people have improvised hand-washing stations. \n\nThe “dragon station,” our modified version of a DIY Camp Sink, is a community favorite. For about US$50-$70 worth of materials, this turns two buckets with lids, a pump, a hose and some sort of basin – and, in our case, a plastic dragon repurposed as a faucet and soap dispenser – into a mechanism that takes clean water from one bucket and disposes dirty water into the other. In comparison, the commercial hand-washing stations we researched cost over $400 and were in high demand, taking a minimum of four to six weeks to ship.",

      "topic": "philosophy",
      "intro": "A 2016 peace agreement between the Colombian government and the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, was supposed to bring peace to this South American country after a 52-year civil war that killed 220,000 people.",
      "body": "Instead, nearly 300 community organizers and activists have been murdered since the accords were signed in November 2016. Hundreds more have received death threats. Eight activists were killed in March 2018 alone. \n\nDuring the same period, the overall homicide rate in Colombia has dropped to an all-time low. \n\nAs violence researchers who focus on conflict and inequality, we wanted to explore the data on the recent spate of targeted assassinations. Why are so many Colombian activists dying? \n\n## Indigenous leaders under fire \n\nMost of the community organizers assassinated in Colombia over the past 16 months were political activists from three largely rural communities: the small-scale farmers generally called “peasants” here, indigenous people and Afro-Colombians. These populations face persistent social and economic discrimination in Colombia. \n\nIndigenous organizers have been particular targets of the violence. Just 3 percent of Colombia’s population identifies as indigenous, but 12 percent of the civil society leaders slain in 2017 were indigenous. \n\nThe crimes do not seem to be racially motivated. Rather, they appear to be political crimes, a retaliation against the country’s 2016 peace process. \n\nMurders have generally declined since the accords, dropping from 12,252 in 2016 to 11,781 in 2017. Colombia’s homicide rate is still worse than almost every other country in the world. But it’s a third of what it was two decades ago, at the peak of the country’s civil war. \n\nCertain areas, however, have seen in marked uptick in political violence. The majority of the slain activists live in remote rural areas of Colombia, in provinces like Cauca, Antioquia, Putumayo and Nariño. \n\nHistorically, the government has been either absent or very weak in these places. That allowed guerrilla groups and drug cartels to emerge in these areas in the late 20th century. These areas were home to some of the most brutal violence of Colombia’s civil conflict.",

      "topic": "agriculture",
      "intro": "How would you like to dig into a “recycled” snack? Or take a swig of juice with “reprocessed” ingredients made from other food byproducts? Without the right marketing, these don’t sound like the most appetizing options.",
      "body": "Enter “upcycling.” That’s the relatively recent term for the age-old concept of using low-valued foods or food processing byproducts to generate new food products. Time-honored examples of this concept include sausages made from meat scraps and jams or jellies made from overripe fruit. In many cases, this waste would have otherwise been used as animal feed or sent to the compost pile. \n\nA certification program may soon label products you’ll see at your local store. Upcycled Food Association \n\nThe Upcycled Food Association defines upcycled foods as those that “use ingredients that otherwise would not have gone to human consumption, are procured and produced using verifiable supply chains, and have a positive impact on the environment.” An official definition may allow manufacturers to market to a target audience and encourage consumers and food processors to consider upcycled products. The Association launched a new Upcycled Certification Standard in 2021. Soon enough you may notice an upcycled label on items at the grocery store. \n\nFood waste is a monumental problem, and this nascent trend, with a buzzy new name designed to appeal to consumers, could help. As an economist and a food engineer, we’ve worked with food companies to minimize waste and find markets for underutilized or otherwise trashed food items. Here’s how upcycling works. \n\nMore than 40% of some fragile crops end up wasted. Sandy Huffaker/AFP \n\n## Massive amounts of food get wasted \n\nGlobally, more than one-third of all current food production will be lost or wasted somewhere between the farm or ranch and the consumer’s garbage can. Food “losses” may be due to improper handling or storage conditions on the farm or in the food distribution process, whereas food “waste” often results from limited retail shelf life or consumers simply not making use of perishable products before they spoil in the fridge. \n\nWorldwide annual loss estimates for highly perishable crops, such as fruits and vegetables, exceed 20%, with certain leafy greens and tropical fruits exceeding 40%. In the U.S. alone, estimates of food loss and waste in recent years have ranged from US$200 billion to $300 billion. Both the World Trade Organization and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization have increased emphasis on preventing food insecurity by minimizing food loss and food waste. \n\nIn addition to the financial impact, food waste also contributes to environmental problems. The FAO estimates that about 8% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions can be traced to the carbon footprint of food loss and waste. Landfills generate greenhouse gas emissions, and recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates indicate food waste is the single largest contributor to landfill volume, making up more than a fifth of what ends up at the dump. \n\nIn addition, when food is wasted, all of the natural resources used to produce the food, including water, energy and land resources, are wasted. \n\n## Peels, shells and past-their-prime ingredients \n\nFrom an economics standpoint, finding market outlets for otherwise wasted products makes sense, and the food industry recognizes that fact. Much of what’s left over as waste once a food is processed contains valuable nutritional components, even though it’s currently only used for animal feed or just thrown away. Fortunately, current laws require animal feed to be treated the same as human food, so many waste streams are already handled using sanitary practices and are safe for human consumption. \n\nA number of economically viable upcycled products are currently on the market. Fruit pomace – all the fibrous bits left after fruit juice production – bolsters the flavor and nutritional content of snack foods. Wheat middlings – everything left after milling that’s not flour – are added to breakfast cereals to increase the content of vitamins, minerals and fiber. Whey protein from cheese production increases the protein content of health bars and protein shakes. \n\nThere’s flour made from the pulp byproducts of soybean and almond milk production, which is sold as baking mixes or upcycled flours. There’s craft beer that uses surplus unsold bread as the fermentation substrate. One group collects and distributes second-tier produce before it goes bad. Other examples include pecan shell flour, dried vegetable peels as soup ingredients, and powders made from waste fruits and vegetables that can be added to beverages and snack bars. \n\nWith our colleagues here at the Robert M. Kerr Food and Agricultural Products Center at Oklahoma State, we’ve had the opportunity to work on a number of products that would be considered upcycled foods. \n\nIdeas for new upcycled products come from researchers within our facility who identify a waste stream with untapped potential, or they originate with an entrepreneur who has a product idea. Either way, interdisciplinary teams here brainstorm ideas, create experimental prototypes and eventually conduct sensory evaluations – addressing the look, taste, aroma or texture of a potential new product.",

      "title": "Moving beyond pro/con debates over genetically engineered crops",
      "topic": "agriculture",
      "intro": "Since the 1980s biologists have used genetic engineering to express novel traits in crop plants. Over the last 20 years, these crops have been grown on more than one billion acres in the United States and globally. Despite their rapid adoption by farmers, genetically engineered (GE) crops remain controversial among many consumers, who have sometimes found it hard to obtain accurate information.",
      "body": "Last month the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a review of 20 years of data regarding GE crops. The report largely confirms findings from previous National Academies reports and reviews produced by other major scientific organizations around the world, including the World Health Organization and the European Commission. \n\nI direct a laboratory that studies rice, a staple food crop for half the world’s people. Researchers in my lab are identifying genes that control tolerance to environmental stress and resistance to disease. We use genetic engineering and other genetic methods to understand gene function. \n\nI strongly agree with the NAS report that each crop, whether bred conventionally or developed through genetic engineering, should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Every crop is different, each trait is different and the needs of each farmer are different too. More progress in crop improvement can be made by using both conventional breeding and genetic engineering than using either approach alone. \n\n## Convergence between biotech and conventional breeding \n\nNew molecular tools are blurring the distinction between genetic improvements made with conventional breeding and those made with modern genetic methods. One example is marker assisted breeding, in which geneticists identify genes or chromosomal regions associated with traits desired by farmers and/or consumers. Researchers then look for particular markers (patterns) in a plant’s DNA that are associated with these genes. Using these genetic markers, they can efficiently identify plants carrying the desired genetic fingerprints and eliminate plants with undesirable genetics. \n\nTen years ago my collaborators and I isolated a gene, called Sub1, that controls tolerance to flooding. Million of rice farmers in South and Southeast Asia grow rice in flood prone regions, so this trait is extremely valuable. Most varieties of rice will die after three days of complete submergence but plants with the Sub1 gene can withstand two weeks of complete submergence. Last year, nearly five million farmers grew Sub1 rice varieties developed by my collaborators at the International Rice Research Institute using marker assisted breeding. \n\nIn another example, researchers identified genetic variants that are associated with hornlessness (referred to as “polled”) in cattle – a trait that is common in beef breeds but rare in dairy breeds. Farmers routinely dehorn dairy cattle to protect their handlers and prevent the animals from harming each other. Because this process is painful and frightening for the animals, veterinary experts have called for research into alternative options. \n\nIn a study published last month, scientists used genome editing and reproductive cloning to produce dairy cows that carried a naturally occurring mutation for hornlessness. This approach has the potential to improve the welfare of millions of cattle each year. \n\n## Reducing chemical insecticides and enhancing yield \n\nIn assessing how GE crops affect crop productivity, human health and the environment, the NAS study primarily focused on two traits that have been engineered into plants: resistance to insect pests and tolerance of herbicides. \n\nThe study found that farmers who planted crops engineered to contain the insect-resistant trait – based on genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt – generally experienced fewer losses and applied fewer chemical insecticide sprays than farmers who planted non-Bt varieties. It also concluded that farms where Bt crops were planted had more insect biodiversity than farms where growers used broad-spectrum insecticides on conventional crops.",
